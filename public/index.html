      <p class="intro">Did you know that in developing, low-income countries, every additional year of education can increase a person's future income by an average of 10%?
          By donating books to Books For All you can play a part in not only bringing the joy of reading to millions of people who might otherwise have no access to books
          but also the ability to liberate them in a way they or any memeber in their family ever has.

  <h3>Make A Difference</h3>

      <section>

          <p>
            "Outdated and worn-out textbooks are often shared by six or more students in many parts of the world. In Tanzania, for example, only 3.5% of all 
            grade 6 pupils had sole use of a reading textbook. In Cameroon, there are 11 primary school students for every reading textbook and 13 for every
            mathematics textbook in grade 2. Workbooks, exercise sheets, readers and other core materials to help students learn their lessons are in short 
            supply. Teachers also need materials to help prepare their lessons, share with their students, and guide their lessons."
